SpacebarInvaders
===

SpacebarInvaders is a small HTML5 canvas game based on the classic arcade game Space Invaders. 

This code was created while following a walkthrough written by Mike Thomas of Atomic Robot Design. You can find the details of the walkthrough [here](http://atomicrobotdesign.com/blog/htmlcss/build-a-vertical-scrolling-shooter-game-with-html5-canvas-part-1/).

Stretch Goals:
[] Add difficulty levels that affect speed and number of enemies
[] Change the lasers to images
[] Keep track of high score via localStorage
[] Add limit to number of enemies that can get by the ship

Sycamore Education is planning on using this canvas game as part of their second annual code camp. The Sycamore Code Camp's goal is to make programming fun and exciting for students of all ages. See more at [www.sycamorecodecamp.com](http://www.sycamorecodecamp.com).
